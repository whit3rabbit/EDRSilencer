# EDRSilencer
Inspired by the closed source FireBlock tool [FireBlock](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2023/09/nighthawk-0-2-6-three-wise-monkeys/) from MdSec NightHawk, I decided to create my own version and this tool was created with the aim of blocking the outbound traffic of running EDR processes using Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) APIs.

This tool offers the following features:
- Search known running EDR processes and add WFP filter to block its outbound traffic
- Add WFP filter for a specific process
- Remove all WFP filters created by this tool
- Remove a specific WFP filter by filter id
- Support to run in C2 with in-memory PE execution module (e.g., `BruteRatel's memexec`)
- Some EDR controls (e.g., minifilter) deny access when a process attempts to obtain a file handle of its EDR processes (e.g., through `CreateFileW`). However, the `FwpmGetAppIdFromFileName0` API, which is used to obtain the FWP app id of the targeted EDR process, calls `CreateFileW` internally. To avoid this, a custom `FwpmGetAppIdFromFileName0` was implemented to construct the app id without invoking `CreateFileW`, thus preventing unexpected failures when adding a WFP filter to an EDR process

**As I do not have access to all these EDRs for testing, please do not hesitate to correct me if the listed processes (edrProcess in `EDRSilencer.c`) prove insufficient in blocking all alert, detection, or event forward traffic.**

## XOR Obfuscation and Customization

To make it more difficult for signature-based detection, all EDR-related process names are XOR-obfuscated within the binary. This section details how to customize this obfuscation.

### Key Components

- **`gen_xor.py`**: A Python script that takes a list of plaintext process names and a secret key, then outputs a ready-to-compile C file (`process.c`) containing the XOR-encrypted data.
- **`verify_xor.py`**: A utility script to verify that the data in `process.c` can be correctly decrypted with the secret key. This is useful for ensuring integrity after making changes.
- **`process.c`**: An **auto-generated** file containing the encrypted process names. You should not edit this file manually; it should always be generated by `gen_xor.py`.

### How to Regenerate the Encrypted Process List

Follow these steps if you wish to change the XOR key or modify the list of targeted processes.

**Step 1: Modify the Configuration**

1.  **Change the Process List (Optional)**: Open `gen_xor.py` and add, edit, or remove entries from the `PROCESS_NAMES` list.
2.  **Change the XOR Key**: To change the key, you must update the `XOR_KEY` variable in **two** files:
    -   `gen_xor.py`
    -   `verify_xor.py`

    *Note: You do not need to change the key in any `.c` files; the generator script handles that automatically.*

**Step 2: Generate the New C Source File**

Run the generator script and redirect its output to create the new `process.c` file. This will overwrite the existing version.

```bash
python3 gen_xor.py > process.c
```

**Step 3: Verify the Integrity of the New File**

Run the verification script to confirm that the new `process.c` was generated correctly and that the encrypted data matches the plaintext source.

```bash
python3 verify_xor.py
```

You should see a success message confirming that all definitions and struct entries are correct.

**Step 4: Recompile the Project**

After successfully regenerating and verifying `process.c`, recompile the entire project to apply the changes.

```bash
make
```

## Improving Stealth

For better operational security, it is recommended to change the default provider name used by this tool. When a new provider is registered with the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP), its name may be logged, making the default value of `EDR Silencer Provider` a clear indicator of the tool's presence.

To blend in with legitimate system activity, you should change this name to something more common before compiling.

**How to Change the Provider Name**

1.  Open the `utils.h` file.
2.  Locate the following line:

    ```c
    #define EDR_PROVIDER_NAME L"EDR Silencer Provider"
    ```

3.  Replace `"EDR Silencer Provider"` with a more generic name. Here are some suggestions that mimic legitimate software providers:

    -   `"Microsoft Corporation"`
    -   `"VMware, Inc."`
    -   `"CrowdStrike, Inc."`
    -   `"Cisco Systems, Inc."`

4.  Save the file and recompile the project using `make`.

## Testing Environment
Tested in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016

## Building the Project

This project uses a `Makefile` for easy compilation of both the executable and the DLL. The following targets are available:

-   `make` or `make release`: Compiles the release version of the executable (`EDRSilencer.exe`).
-   `make debug`: Compiles the debug version of the executable (`EDRSilencer_debug.exe`).
-   `make dll`: Compiles the release version of the DLL (`EDRSilencer.dll`).
-   `make dll-debug`: Compiles the debug version of the DLL (`EDRSilencer_debug.dll`).
-   `make clean`: Removes all compiled files and object files.

To compile, simply run the desired `make` command from the project root. For example, to build the release executable:

```bash
make
```

To build the release DLL:
```bash
make dll
```

## Executable Usage
```
Usage: EDRSilencer.exe [--quiet | -q] <command>

Commands:
- `blockedr`: Add network rules to block traffic of all detected target processes.
- `add <path>`: Add a network rule to block traffic for a specific process.
  - Example: `EDRSilencer.exe add "C:\Windows\System32\curl.exe"`
- `removeall`: Remove all network rules applied by this tool.
- `remove <id>`: Remove a specific network rule by its ID.

Options:
- `-q`, `--quiet`: Suppress all console output. This is useful when running the tool from a C2 framework or in other non-interactive sessions.
```

## DLL Usage

The project can also be compiled as a DLL (`EDRSilencer.dll`) for use with tools like `rundll32.exe` or for injection into other processes.

### How to Use

To ensure safe initialization, you must call the exported `Initialize` function after the DLL is loaded. This will trigger the EDR blocking functionality in a separate thread, avoiding deadlocks.

By default, the DLL operates in **quiet mode**.

### Exported Functions

The DLL exports the following functions, which can be called by other processes:

-   `Initialize(void)`: **(Required)** Call this function first to activate the EDR blocking rules. It runs quietly by default.
-   `BlockEDR(BOOL quiet)`: Manually triggers the blocking of known EDRs. Set `quiet` to `TRUE` or `FALSE` to control console output.
-   `AddRuleByPath(BOOL quiet, const char* processPath)`: Adds a block rule for a specific process executable path.
-   `RemoveAllRules(BOOL quiet)`: Removes all filtering rules created by this tool.
-   `RemoveRuleByID(BOOL quiet, const char* ruleIdStr)`: Removes a specific rule by its ID.

## Example
